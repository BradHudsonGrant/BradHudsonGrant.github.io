             <h2>BT</h2>
             <p class="project-description">
                At BT, I provided  support in a diverse agile squad as a full stack developer using tools such as Jira and confluence to help track and document our progress. 
                I worked in their enterprise  codebase implementing a new solution to their e-commerce journeys.  The project was for a new product (Cloud Voice Express) and required a UX redesign.  
                As part of the project we upgraded from AEM 6.2 to AEM 6.4 with the intent to use 6.4’s  newer features on our components.
             </p>
             <p class="project-description">
                My agile squad consisting of a variety of roles (UX, UI, BA etc.), were tasked with the  sales journey for the new product. 
                Which began from when the customer sees the  home page to customer checkout.  My responsibilities from a business perspective included ensuring all the developers was ensuring all developers were involved with any decisions and refinement sessions,
                helping developers understand the user stories and acceptance criteria to ensure code  was developed at the highest standard.
             </p>  
             <p class="project-description">
                My responsibilities from a technical perspective included creating AEM components  such as a product listing component.
                Implementing logic for filtering products from a  user’s selection or from the available products returned from an API surfaced through  the APIGEE gateway. Logic was developed in the backend using Java and on the  front-end using Angular/Javascript.   
                I also worked closely with the analytics team and built the sales  page analytics to their  requirements using DTM.  
                The tools we used for this project were AngularJS, React, AEM 6.2, 6.4, Apache Sling, Git  and VS Code for developing.
